 - If haskell can not determine types at compile time does it just defer that
   to runtime? If there is not sufficient type information at compile time to
   infer all types does the program fail to compile?
 - (Ord a, Num a) => a -> Ordering
    In the text this says a must have a type that compiles with the
    intersection of Ord an Num but I suspect it is the union of those two
    typeclasses. (p. 153)
 - Ask someone about question 7 (p. 163)

 - There are two forms of polymorphism (parametric and constrained)
