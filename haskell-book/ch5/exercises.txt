## Type Matching

1/2. a) c
     b) d
     c) b
     d) a
     e) e

## Type Arguments

1. a
2. d
3. d
4. c
5. a
6. e
7. e // WTF! it was actually d
8. f // WTF! again!
9. c

## Parametricity

1. Nope, a -> a must return the value it was given.
2. `f x y = x` or `f x y = y`
3. `f x y = y` is the only implementation. If you change the type of the
   arguments to be the same you can have two valid implementations.

## Apply Yourself

1. `myConcat :: [Char] -> [Char]`, because the second argument is a concrete
    type `[Char]`.
2. `myMult :: Fractional a => a -> a`, because the division operation forces a
    type of Fractional.
3. `myTake :: Int -> [Char]`, because Int is already a concrete type and [a]
    is constrained to be a [Char].
4. `myCom :: Int -> Bool`, because lenght forces the argument to be `Int`.
5. `myAlph :: Char -> Bool`, because the `Char` literal forces the arguemnt to
    be `Char`.

## Chapter Exercises

### Multiple Choice

1. c
2. a
3. b
4. c

### Determine the type

1. a) `Num a => a`
   b) `Num a => (a, [Char])`
   c) `(Integer, [Char])`
   d) `Bool`
   e) `Int`
   f) `Bool`
2. `w :: Num a => a`
3. `z :: Num a => a -> a`
4. `f :: Fractiona a => a`
5. `f :: [Char]`

### Does it compile?

1. No, `bigNum` is a value, not a functgion that can be applied.
2. Yeah, why not. I don't see how this wouldn't compile, unless assigning
    `IO ()` is not allowed.
3. Nope, you can not apply `10` to the value of `5`.
4. No, because `c` is undefined and if you are using the REPL the ordering is
    wrong.

### Type variable or specific type constructor?

1. a is constrained polymorphic, b is fully polymorphic, and the last two
    types are concrete.
2. zed is fully polymorphic, Zed and Blah are concrete types.
3. a is fully polymorphic, b is constrained polymorphic, and C is concrete.
4. f and g are fully polymorphic and C is concrete.

### Write a typoe signature

1. `functionH :: [a] -> a`
2. `functionC :: a -> b -> Bool`, wrong it was
    `(Ord a) => a -> a -> Bool` because the `>` comparison forced the
    args to be Ord.
3. `functionS :: (a, b) -> b`

### Given a type, write the function

1. `i x = x`
2. `c x y = x`
3. Yes, these type definitions are the same thing.
4. `c' x y = y`
5. `r x = []`
6. `co x y = (\ z -> x (y z))`
7. `a x y = y`
8. `a' x y = x y`

### Fix it

1. ```
module Sing where

fstString :: [Char] -> [Char]
fstString x = x ++ " in the rain"

sndString :: [Char] -> [Char]
sndString x = x ++ " over the rainbow"

sing = if (x > y) then fstString x else sndString y
        where x = "Singin"
              y = "Somewhere"
```
2. ```
module Sing where

fstString :: [Char] -> [Char]
fstString x = x ++ " in the rain"

sndString :: [Char] -> [Char]
sndString x = x ++ " over the rainbow"

sing = if (x < y) then fstString x else sndString y
        where x = "Singin"
              y = "Somewhere"
```
3. ```
module Arith3Broken where

main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn $ show (1 + 2)
    putStrLn $ "10"
    putStrLn $ show (negate (-1))
    putStrLn $ show ((+) 0 blah)
        where blah = negate 1
```

### Type-Kwon-Do

1. ```
f :: Int -> String
f = undefined

g :: String -> Char
g = undefined

h :: Int -> Char
h x = g (f x)
```
2. ```
data A
data B
data C

q :: A -> B
q = undefined

w :: B -> C
w = undefined

e :: A -> C
e x = w (q x)
```
3. ```
data X
data Y
data Z

xz :: X -> Z
xz = undefined

yz :: Y -> Z
yz = undefined

xform :: (X, Y) -> (Z, Z)
xform (x, y) = (xz x, xz x)
```
4. ```
munge :: (x -> y) -> (y -> (w, z)) -> x -> w
munge f g x = fst (g (f x))
```
