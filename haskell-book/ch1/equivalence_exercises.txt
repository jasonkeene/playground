1. λxy.xz

    Not a since z and y need to be distinct
    b since m can be replaced for x and n for y
    Not c since the second argument should not be in the body

    Answer: b

2. λxy.xxy

    Not a since p is not the same as m
    Not b since the body requires three terms
    c since we just replaced x with a and y with b

    Answer: c, but I am a bit confused since the notation is missing a '.'
            (dot) to indicate the body

3. λxyz.zx

    Not a since we are missing the x term in the body
    b since we just replaced z with t and z with s
    Not c since y doesn't exist in the body

    Answer: b
